        <p>
            This is a brand new portable library for talking to the CopyNES device.  
            The original software that shipped with the device is Windows only 
            and uses the custom FTDI DLL to talk to the device.  Since then, 
            FTDI has released virtual com port (VCP) drivers for Windows, Linux 
            and Mac OS X that makes the FTDI usb serial chip used in the CopyNES 
            look like two standard serial devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must have the VCP driver installed on your system before this 
            library will work.  If you are using Linux, the 2.6.9 or newer kernel 
            contains the driver.  I'm currently using Ubuntu 8.04 and when I plugged 
            in my CopyNES, it was automatically detected, the VCP module was 
            automatically loaded and the two serial devices were automatically 
            created.
        </p>
        <p>
            The copynes_open() function takes the string paths to the two serial 
            devices.  On my Ubuntu system, the two serial devices were registered as 
            /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1.  On the CopyNES, the ttyUSB0 device is 
            the data channel and the ttyUSB1 is the control channel.
        </p>
        <p>
            This library is still a work in progress.  I'm implementing 
            features as I need them, with plans to eventually support all 
            CopyNES functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy!
