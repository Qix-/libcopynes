libcopynes

This is a brand new portable library for talking to the CopyNES device 
sold through retrousb.com.  The original software that shipped with the 
device is Windows only and uses the custom FTDI DLL to talk to the 
device.  Since then, FTDI has released virtual com port (VCP) drivers 
for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X that makes the FTDI usb serial chip used 
in the CopyNES look like two standard serial devices.

This library is designed to control the CopyNES through the VCP serial 
devices instead of the old custom FTDI drivers.  This makes the library 
extremely portable and expands the number of platforms the CopyNES can 
be used on.

You must have the VCP driver installed on your system before this 
library will work.  If you are using Linux, the 2.6.9 or newer kernel 
contains the driver.  I'm currently using Ubuntu 8.04 and when I plugged 
by CopyNES in, it was automatically detected, the VCP module was 
automatically loaded and the two serial devices were automatically 
created.

The copynes_open() function takes the string paths to the two serial 
devices.  On my Ubuntu system, the two serial devices were registered as 
/dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1.  On the CopyNES, the ttyUSB0 device is 
the data channel and the ttyUSB1 is the control channel.

Currently this library is still a work in progress.  I'm implementing 
features as I need them with plans to support all CopyNES functions.

If you use this library in a project, please let me know what you're 
using it for.  If you find a bug, let me know, or better yet, send me a 
patch to fix it ;-)

Enjoy!
